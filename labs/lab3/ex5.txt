=== Performance Summary ===
1. Default distribution: Load imbalance causes idle threads
2. Splitting heavy tasks: Better utilization of threads
3. Balanced distribution: Optimal thread utilization
The key lesson is to distribute workload evenly across
available threads to minimize waiting time and maximize
parallel efficiency.
